<b>Meteo system AMS.3 based on real-life LKPR equipment</b>

- Can display weather from FSX/P3D (for TowerView when controlling on VATSIM/IVAO)<br>
- You must install custom panel with custom gauge and LUA script into FSX. Open Resources folder for those files!<br>
- Optimised for 17" 1280x1024 screens like the real unit :-)
